    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p class="p"><span id="werise">WeRise</span> is a movement to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs
      in the process.
      We're building an army of young people to make climate change an urgent priority across America, end the
      corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics, and elect leaders who stand up for the health and
      wellbeing of all people.

      We are ordinary young people who are scared about what the climate crisis means for the people and places we love.
      We are gathering in classrooms, living rooms, and worship halls across the country. Everyone has a role to play.
      Public opinion is already with us - if we unite by the millions we can turn this into political power and reclaim
      our democracy.

      We are not looking to the right or left. We look forward. Together, we will change this country and this world,
      sure as the sun rises each morning.</p>

        This brighter future is being held hostage by a handful of wealthy oil and gas executives who will stop at
        nothing to squeeze the last bit of money out of the earth. They’ve gotten away with it by lying to the public
        and buying off politicians of both parties to stall progress and secure massive giveaways for themselves. Their
        incredible wealth means their families will be fine, but the rest of us won’t. </p>
