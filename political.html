        <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Political Engagement</h1>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>1. We support candidates who, if elected, would represent a significant break with the status quo for their district.&nbsp;</strong>We want candidates who take major leaps forward in one or more of our policy priority areas (see below). This looks different in different parts of America. Examples could include:</p>
        <ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A politician in Louisiana who opposes public bailouts of the oil industry.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A politician in Virginia who opposes a pipeline being developed by the state’s most powerful corporation, Dominion.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A politician in Minnesota who supports a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy in their state.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A politician who only has moderately strong stances on climate issues, but who is going up against one of the worst-of-the-worst fossil fuel puppets.</p></li></ul>
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>2. We support politicians who will represent us, not the fossil fuel industry.&nbsp;</strong>Whether or not a candidate is willing to take money from the oil, gas and coal industry is a fairly clear litmus test of whose interests that politician is likely to represent.</p>

        <ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In primary elections, we only endorse candidates who take the “<a href="http://nofossilfuelmoney.org"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><em>No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge</em></strong></span></a><strong><em>”</em> </strong>to “reject contributions from the oil, gas, and coal industry and instead prioritize the health of our families, climate, and democracy over fossil fuel industry profits.”</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In general elections, we may support (but not endorse) a candidate who has not signed the pledge or has taken money from the fossil fuel industry because we recognize that an imperfect candidate could, in some cases, still represent a significant leap forward (see above) by defeating a powerful opponent with a long history of putting the interests of oil and gas executives first. No matter what, we will make this a major demand for general elections and push candidates on this issue.</p></li></ul>
